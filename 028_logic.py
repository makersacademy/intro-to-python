# As we've mentioned, while numeric operators evaluate to
# numbers, like this:

1 + 2 # evaluates to 3

# Comparison operators evaluate to True or False

1 == 2 # evaluates to False
2 == 2 # evaluates to True

# The `if` keyword looks at whether the conditional
# expression evaluates to True or False to decide whether to
# execute its block, or the else block.

# We can use this information to combine conditions using a
# new kind of operators: logical operators.

# Consider this function:

def starts_with_x_or_y(the_str):
  first_letter = the_str[0]
  #                      VV look at this!
  if first_letter == "x" or first_letter == "y":
    return "It does!"
  else:
    return "It does not."

# That `or` operator says "evaluate to true if the condition
# on the left, or on the right, or both evaluate to true".

# Operators like `or` are called 'logical' or 'Boolean'
# operators.

# There are others here too.

# @TASK: Research by searching the web for "python
# logical operators" and complete the exercises below.

# I've started it for you.
