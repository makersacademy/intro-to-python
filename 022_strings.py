# A string is a sequence of characters (letters).

# You've already seen the string syntax dotted around. Here
# it is:

my_name = "Kay"
print(my_name)

# They are surrounded by double quotes:

my_name = "Kay"

# Or single quotes:

my_name = 'Kay'

# In Python, there's no meaningful difference between the
# two.

# Try out creating a string with your name in it:

your_name = ???
print(your_name)

# @TASK: Check your work by running this file with:
# python 022_strings.py

# As you may have worked out, the `print(string)` function
# prints a string to the shell so you can see it.

# When you're satisfied, move on to 023_string_indexing.py
