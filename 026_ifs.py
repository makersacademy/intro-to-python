from lib.helpers import check_that_these_are_equal

# Programs often have to make decisions based on their
# input. For this, we use the `if` keyword.

# Here is an example:

leaves_on_the_tree = 0

if leaves_on_the_tree == 0:
  print("It must be winter — or a dead tree")

# Let's break this down:

# The `if` keyword tells Python we want to execute some code
# conditionally.

# The `leaves_on_the_tree == 0` is the conditional
# expression. If this evaluates to True, then the block of
# code afterwards will be run.

# Within this, the `==` is a comparison operator. It
# evaluates to True if the value on the left and on the
# right are equal.

# The colon `:` indicates the start of a new block of code.

# The indented block of code after the if is the conditional
# block. Python will run it if the condition evaluates to
# True.

# We can also have an `else` to cover the other case:

if leaves_on_the_tree == 0:
  print("It must be winter — or a dead tree")
else:
  print("This is a happy tree with nice leaves")

# When Python sees the `else:`, it will execute the next
# block of code only if the condition evaluated to False.

# These blocks are mutually exclusive — only one of them
# will run, never both.
