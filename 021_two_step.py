# Here's a function:

def add_one_and_divide_by_two_with_statements(num):
  added = num + 1
  halved = added / 2
  return halved

print("add_one_and_divide_by_two_with_statements(5) is:")

print(
  add_one_and_divide_by_two_with_statements(5)
)

# You could also do this with a single expression, like this:

def add_one_and_divide_by_two_with_an_expression(num):
  return (num + 1) / 2

print("add_one_and_divide_by_two_with_an_expression(5) is:")

print(
  add_one_and_divide_by_two_with_an_expression(5)
)

# The statements just break it up a bit more. We'll see some
# more uses for statements and variables soon, but for now
# let's practice using them.

# @TASK: Complete these functions.

# == Exercise One ==

  divide=num/2
  added=divided+1
  return added

  divide_by_two_and_add_one(6),
  4.0
)

# == Exercise Two ==

print("")
print("Function: multiply_by_forty_and_add_sixty")

def multiply_by_forty_and_add_sixty(num):
  # Multiply num by forty, and then add sixty
  pass # <-- This does nothing, replace it with your code

check_that_these_are_equal(
  multiply_by_forty_and_add_sixty(3423),

# == Exercise Three ==

print("")
print("Function: add_together_and_double")

def add_together_and_double(num_a, num_b):

  doubled=added*2
  return doubled
