# So far you've seen very simple computations.
# I'm going to show you how to perform more advanced ones.
# Before I do, let's break down `add_one` a bit further`.
# I'm going to give you some more terminology.

def add_one(num):
  return num + 1

# You may need to widen the panel or zoom out to see the table:

# | Code           | What is it?                                        |
# | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
# | def            | `def` is a keyword that defines a new function     |
# | add_one        | `add_one` is the function name                     |
# | (num)          | `(num)` is the parameter list                      |
# | num            | `num` is a parameter                               |
# | :              | The `:` symbol indicates the body should start now |
# | return num + 1 | `return num + 1` is a statement                    |
# | num + 1        | `num + 1` is an expression                         |
# | num            | `num` here is a variable                           |
# | +              | `+` is an operator                                 |
# | 1              | `1` is a literal number                            |

# Don't worry about remembering all of that table, but pay
# attention now to three items: operators, statements, and
# expressions. We're going to look at all three next.

# First we'll look at operators.

# @TASK: To be a great programmer you will have to become a
# great researcher. Let's get started:
#
# 1. Search the web for "Python operators", to
# 2. Find and fill out the following list of operators.
#
# I've started it for you.

# Addition
added = 2 + 3
print(f"2 + 3 = {added} (should be 5)")

# Multiplication
multiplied = 2 * 3
print(f"2 * 3 = {multiplied} (should be 6)")

# @TASK: For each section below:
#
# 1. Uncomment the code by removing the `# `
# 2. Replace the `?` with the right operator
# 3. Check it by running `python 016_operators.py`


# == Subtraction ==

# subtracted = 2 ? 3
# print(f"2 ? 3 = {subtracted} (should be -1)")

# == Division ==

# divided = 2 ? 3
# print(f"2 ? 3 = {divided} (should be 0.6666666666666666)")

# This kind of 'decimal point' number, 0.6666666666666666 is
# called a float, by the way, meaning 'floating point'.

# == Modulus ==
# Sometimes known as "remainder if we divide 3 by 2"

# modulus = 3 ? 2
# print(f"3 ? 2 = {modulus} (should be 1)")

# == Floor division ==
# Sometimes known as "division without remainder"

# floor_divided = 2 ? 3
# print(f"2 ? 3 = {floor_divided} (should be 0)")

# == Exponentiation ==
# Sometimes known as "2 to the power of 3"

# expr = 2 ? 3
# print(f"2 ? 3 = {expr} (should be 8)")

# There are many more operators in Python that you can
# research. You're very welcome to try out a few below:
